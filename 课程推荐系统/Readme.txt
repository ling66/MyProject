Some important things about this project:

1. The whole project is included in IWSAssignmentOnew_v1 folder. Please go into this folder and double click IWSAssignmentOnew_v1 application label under Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 environment.(It is tested on school computer on lever 10 lab)

2. Upload Test files:(files are included in submit folder)
   2.1 Please make sure fill "File Upload Path" field firstly (Because I have done some test on school's computer. I don't have enough permission to access special drive, so we add this field to let user give the specific position which have enough permission to store the files)
       For example, I use this path for my testing:
	   c:\Users\S3300154\Desktop
   2.2 the files name have to be: student.csv and course.csv
   2.3 the format for each file has to be the same as training data.
   
   Note: because the program hard code the file name, If you want to do any change, please go to StudentInfoInputForm.aspx.cs file at line 18 and line 23. Then you can do any change.

3. The 项目分析报告.pdf includes all the detail about this project.

4. The interface ignore the core/elective input part, the program assumes Course 1,2,3,4 has the fixed value for this attribute.

5. The implementation of the final interface also provides all the intermediate calculation results. 


Thank you very much!
